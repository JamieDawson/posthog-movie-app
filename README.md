## Want is a Posthog Survey?

A PostHog survey is a feature that lets you collect direct feedback from your users inside your product. Instead of sending them away to a form or email, PostHog shows the survey right in your app or website. This is useful if you want your users to give you details on what they like or dislike about your website or products you're selling, without having to send them an email.

# üìù Posthog Survey:

## What is a Posthog Survey?

A PostHog survey is a feature that allows you to collect direct feedback from your users inside your product. Instead of sending them to a form or email, PostHog shows the survey right in your app or website. This is useful if you want your users to provide details on what they like or dislike about your website or products, without having to send them an email.

# How do I get a Posthog Survey on my website?

Below are the steps to follow if you want to create your own survey on your website. If you've already configured your project to have Posthog, you can skip the configuration section and go to the **Adding a Survey to your app** section of this Readme file.

## Configure Posthog into your project:

1. Create an account on [https://posthog.com/](https://posthog.com/)
2. Create your organization by giving it a name.
   ![Posthog screenshot of the page where you add your organization name.](./src/assets/Posthog_step_one.png)
3. Let Posthog know which features you're interested in.
   ![Posthog Screenshot of the page where you select the features you're interested in.](./src/assets/Posthog_step_two.png)
4. Select a framework you want to attach Posthog to. I ended up picking React because that's what I used to make my app.
   ![Posthog Screenshot of the page where you select your framework](./src/assets/Posthog_step_three.png)
5. Follow the installation guide. This part is pretty easy. All you have to do is run an npm install on posthog-js, apply your VITE environment variables, and update your main.tsx file.
   ![Posthog Screenshot of the page that shows you how to install Posthog on your app.](./src/assets/Posthog_step_four.png)

**Note for TypeScript users:**
If you‚Äôre seeing warnings or errors in your main.tsx file, use this version to resolve them:

```
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import { PostHogProvider } from "posthog-js/react";

const options = {
  api_host: import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST,
  // Remove 'defaults'
};

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

if (!rootElement) {
  throw new Error(
    'Root element with id "root" not found. Make sure your index.html contains <div id="root"></div>'
  );
}

createRoot(rootElement).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <PostHogProvider
      apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY}
      options={options}
    >
      <App />
    </PostHogProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

- Removed the defaults property from the options object, as it is not supported by the React PostHogProvider and causes TypeScript errors.
- Added a check to ensure the root element exists before rendering, preventing runtime errors.

6. Select which plan you want (Free or paid)
7. Invite your teammates (Optional)

Your project now has Posthog configured into it. Now it's time to add the survey so it pops up!

## Adding a Survey to your app

1. Click the survey button on the dropdown menu on the left menu. You might need to configure your Surveys API to allow Surveys. Thankfully, that's as easy as two button clicks!

![Screenshot of the Surveys page on Posthog](./src/assets/survey_1.png) 2. Click "Create Survey" and select which one you want. I'll be going with the one that is the most popular and allows users to type out their feedback.

![Screenshot of the page where you select the kind of survey you want.](./src/assets/survey_2.png)
From here you're going to see a lot of options to customize your app:

- Presentation: I'd recommend the Popover option for starting. This will make your survey pop up on the screen.
- Steps: Customize what the question says and what the submit button can say.
- Customization: Change how it looks, from size to color.
- Display conditions: Keep it **All Users** for now. You can hange it later to fit certain conditions
- Completion Conditions: For testing, I'm keeping it as is

Once you've customized your survey, click Save at the top right of the screen.

3. To have your survey active, click the **Launch** button in the top right of the screen. Once you've confirmed the launch, the survey should be on your connected app!

# üìÇ Posthog Query API with Google Sheets:

## What is a Posthog Query API with Google Sheets?

PostHog lets you connect lots of data sources, one of them is Google Sheets! This means you can pull in data from your spreadsheets and use it in PostHog to track trends, see metrics, or combine it with other data without any complicated setup.

## See this functionality in action before learning about it.

Look up [my app](https://posthog-movie-app.netlify.app/) and click the **Posthog Query API** button. It pulls movies from my Google Sheet using the Posthog API and displays films about [Hedgehogs](https://posthog.com/blog/drawing-hedgehogs)!

![Calling the Google Sheets with the Posthog Query API](./src/assets/posthog_sheet_1.png)

## How to set up a Source and use the Posthog API to call the data

Before you start, you'll need a Google sheet with example data.
![Google Sheet with my example data that's being pulled into Posthog](./src/assets/posthog_sheet_2.png)

1. **Connect Google Sheets to PostHog** \
   Go to your PostHog project.
   Navigate to Data pipeline > Sources.
   Add a new Google Sheets source and follow the prompts to connect your sheet.
   Wait for the initial sync to complete. You can trigger a manual sync from the source settings if needed.
2. **Create a Personal API Key in PostHog** \
   Go to your Personal API keys page (Settings --> Search "API")
   Create a new key with Query: Read permission and restrict it to your project for security.
   Copy your API key.
3. **Test if you can access your data.**  
   I recommend using [Postman](https://postman.com/) to test the Posthog API. Here are the steps:

- Set the request to **POST**
- Add this URL to the input:
  `https://us.posthog.com/api/projects/{Project_id}/query`
- Add this JSON to body --> raw

```
{
  "query": {
    "kind": "HogQLQuery",
    "query": "SELECT * FROM googlesheets.NAME_OF_YOUR_SHEET_HERE LIMIT 10"
  }
}
```

- Add these two to your Headers: \
  **KEY**: Authorization **VALUE**: Bearer API_KEY_HERE \
  **KEY** Content-Type **VALUE**: application/json

4.  **Set up your Backend project** \
    This can be done in several ways, but I recommend creating a simple [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) function. You can see my [backend code by clicking here](https://github.com/JamieDawson/posthog-backend-movie-app)
5.  Use the URL generated by Netlify. \
    Now that you have a link generated by Netlify, you can call it on the frontend and have the data displayed!

# üîç Track Events

## What is Event Tracking?

Event tracking involves keeping tabs on what people do in your app, such as when they click, search, or make a purchase. Each action gets sent to PostHog along with extra details (called properties) that explain what happened.

## What event is this app tracking?

This app tracks what users are typing in the search bar. I'm able to see how many times someone would type "Hedgehog" to look up movies with Hedgehog in the title.

## How I set up event tracking in my app.

1. I imported usePostHog from [posthog-js/react](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-js)

```
import { usePostHog } from "posthog-js/react";
```

2. I created an instance of `usePostHog()` inside my App() component.

```
  const posthog = usePostHog();
```

3. Updated my `handleOnSubmit()` function so that if the instance is found, it sends an object to my Posthog account that can be tracked. Using the `posthog.capture` command, I create an object called `movie_search` that contains `search_term` and `results_count`.

```
  const handleOnSubmit = (e: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    if (searchTerm) {
      fetch(SEARCH_API + searchTerm)
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => {
          const results = data.results || [];
          setMovies(results);

          if (posthog) {
            posthog.capture("movie_search", {
              search_term: searchTerm,
              results_count: results.length,
            });
          }
        })
        .catch((err) => console.error("Error fetching search results:", err));
    }
  };
```

## Viewing the data in Posthog!

So now that the data is being sent back to Posthog, let's talk about viewing it.

### Viewing general activity

1. Click **Activity** tab on left dropdown menu
2. Look for the name of the event you created. (Example: `movie_search`)
3. Click **Hide Posthog properties** button to make it easier to find the items in the object.

![Posthog Activity tab](./src/assets/posthog_event_1.png)

### Organizing the data

To organize your data, you'll need to:

1. Click the **Product Analytics** tab on the left side of the screen
2. Click the **New** button on the top-right
3. In the section called **series**, click the name of the event you want to track. In my example, I'm tracking `movie_search`.
4. In the **Breakdown By** section, look up what you want to search for. I want to look up `search_term` and `results_count`, which are the two bits of data sent back in my `movie_search` object!

# Session Replay

## What is Session Replay

Session replay is a playback of what users do on your site. Things like clicks, scrolls, typing, and navigation can be viewed in a screen recording that's captured right from the browser. It helps you see how people actually use your app so you can spot issues or understand behavior without guessing.

## How to set up Session Replay in your app.

### Configuring in Posthog:

Enabling Session Replay in your account is very easy! You're pretty much just clicking three buttons!

1. Click the **Session Replay** button on the left side of the screen.
2. Click the **Configure** button in the top middle of the page.
   ![Posthog Product Analytics tab](./src/assets/posthog_session_1.png)
3. Click the **Record Users Session** button, and you'll have it set up on your account!
   ![Posthog Product Analytics tab](./src/assets/posthog_session_1.png)

### Configuring in your TypeScript app:

1. In your `main.tsx` app, add the `session_recording` object in your `PostHogProvider` \
   This code:

- Imports `posthog-js/react` and provides `PostHogProvider`
- Wraps `PostHogProvider` around your `<App />` component
- Provides the `session_recordings` object, which gives your app the ability to record.
- `session_recording` also includes `maskAllInputs: false`. You would want to set this to true if your input fields were taking sensitive information. But my one input field only takes in the names of films, so I'm not too worried.

```
import { StrictMode } from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import "./index.css";
import App from "./App.jsx";
import { PostHogProvider } from "posthog-js/react";

const options = {
  api_host: import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST,
  session_recording: {
    maskAllInputs: false, // User aren't typing sensitive info in input fields.
  },
};

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

if (!rootElement) {
  throw new Error(
    'Root element with id "root" not found. Make sure your index.html contains <div id="root"></div>'
  );
}

createRoot(rootElement).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <PostHogProvider
      apiKey={import.meta.env.VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY}
      options={options}
    >
      <App />
    </PostHogProvider>
  </StrictMode>
);
```

2. After adding that code, test your app by doing something in it. For me I went to my app and searched "Hedgehog" in the search bar. \
   Once you've added that, Go back to the **Session Replay** button and watch the footage of your session. It might take a few seconds to generate the footage.
